# Fonts

Here you can find some of my fonts, created in BirdFont application.

Main goal is to provide fonts that:
* are free to use,
* look good in retro games

All fonts are available in two flavours, `Mono` and `Sans` (fixed and variable width)

## Current fonts

Available families are now:

* EF64

## Gallery
